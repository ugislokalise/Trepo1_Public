        'title': 'WireGuard® is a new VPN protocol that uses state-of-the-art cryptography'
        'pitch': 'It aims to be securer and more resource efficient than other VPN protocols, such as :openvpn.'
        'ovpn': 'OVPN has been using WireGuard since February 2020 and it''s the VPN protocol that our Android & iOS apps will use.'
        'encryption_security': 'Encryption & security'
        'encryption': 'WireGuard is an opinionated VPN protocol which means that it''s not possible to use any other ciphers than the included combination. As such, WireGuard uses ChaCha20 for symmetric encryption, Curve25519 for Elliptic curve key agreement, BLAKE2s for hashing and HKDF for key derivation. '
        'security': 'There are no known major vulnerabilities and WireGuard is considered secure. WireGuard supports Perfect Forward Secrecy.'
        'perfect_forward_secrecy': 'Perfect forward secrecy means that the encryption key used to encrypt and decrypt data is changed automatically and regularly. If the encryption key is compromised, it exposes only a small portion of the user''s sensitive data.'
        'ovpn_rekey': 'OVPN''s implementation of WireGuard rotates encryption keys automatically, ensuring consistent and constant security.'
        'code_base': 'WireGuard''s code base is substantially smaller than other VPN protocols and thus enables easier audits.'
        'privacy': Privacy
        'privacy_features': 'WireGuard is not built with anonymity in mind. But the same goes for OpenVPN, which is why OVPN has made :link to ensure the integrity of our customers when they connect to our OpenVPN servers.'
        'several_changes': 'several changes'
        'privacy_changes': 'We have <a href="https://www.ovpn.com/en/blog/wireguard-integrity-anonymity/">performed several tweaks</a> in our WireGuard implementation to ensure that our customers can experience optimal privacy.'
        'speed': Speed
        'speed_algorithm': 'The speed & latency depends on which device WireGuard is run on, as well as how users'' internet providers peer with OVPN''s internet providers. Our VPN servers have the processing power to encrypt up to 4000 Mbit/s using WireGuard which is 2x the speed of OpenVPN.'
        'throughput': 'The increased throughput in WireGuard can be explained due to the modern encryption protocols it employs coupled with its ability to make full use of the processor through multithreading. Reaching speeds over 100 Mbit/s should not be an issue on computers, phones and routers.'
        'modern': 'WireGuard combined with our :link allows OVPN to provide our customers with fast speeds and low latencies.'
        'network': 'premium networking partners'
        'stability': Stability
        'stability_openvpn': 'WireGuard is very stable and supports a variety of different operating systems. WireGuard works only over UDP.'
        'tcp': 'WireGuard has roaming built-in which results in a seamless experience on cellphones when switching frin a Wi-Fi network to mobile data (4G). Connections to VPN servers happen instantly, whereas OpenVPN can take several seconds.'
        'user_experience': 'User experience'
        'compatibility': 'WireGuard works well on Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android and a bunch of other operating systems. It is beginning to be included in Linux operating system releases as it has been merged to the Linux 5.6 kernel. Other operating systems require manual installation.'
        'installation': 'Installation only takes a few minutes. The default software is quite user friendly and OVPN has built an easy-to-use WireGuard configuration generator. OVPN is working to include WireGuard into our :client that will make WireGuard super easy to use, together with several other :link.'
        'client': 'custom desktop client'
        'enhancements': 'security enhancements'
        'apps': 'OVPN is developing apps for Android & iOS which will purely utilize WireGuard as the VPN protocol.'
        'active_development': 'Active development'
        'upcoming changes': 'WireGuard is still under active development and we''re excited to see what''s next.'
        'regions': 'WireGuard servers'
        'current': 'OVPN currently has WireGuard servers in the following regions. New WireGuard servers and locations are added regularly.'
        'pricing': 'View pricing →'
    transparency_reports:
        'summary': Summary
        'summary_month': 'Throughout the month of :month, our VPN servers had an uptime of over 99.5%. In total, the OVPN servers encrypted and anonymized **:total TB** of data.'
        'abuse': 'During the month of :month, we received **:abuse requests**.'
        'dmca': 'Out of these, **:abuse were DMCA related**'
        'no_info': 'Since we are a no-log VPN, we have never given out any such information.'
        'below': 'Below are the traffic and uptime statistics from our current data centers.'

        'vpn_servers': 'VPN servers'
        'vpn_servers_in': 'VPN servers in :city, :country'
        'datacenter': 'Our data center in :region has :servers and a **maximum capacity of :capacity Gbit/s**. During :month the traffic load amounted to **:average Mbit/s** on average.'
        'traffic': 'The highest traffic spike was **:highest_speed Mbit/s**, which represents **:highest_speed_percent** of the maximum capacity. The 95th percentile landed on **:highest_speed_percentile Mbit/s**, meaning that 95% of the time, the traffic load was below **:highest_speed_percentile_percent of the maximum capacity**.'
